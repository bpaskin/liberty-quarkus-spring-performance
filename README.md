# OpenLiberty, Quarkus and Spring Boot 

This application is designed to allow like-for-like performance comparisons between OpenLiberty, Quarkus and Spring Boot. This a cloned [repo](https://github.com/quarkusio/spring-quarkus-perf-comparison) from the Quarkus team that created most of the code.  I created the JakartaEE application for OpenLiberty.  

More info coming later.
